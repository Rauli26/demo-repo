eg git clone git@github.com:Rauli26/demo-repo.git. -> It will pull down the repo into the directory I am in

5. Install code editor -> Visual studio code

6. Open one empty folder in VS Code -> clone the git rep -> Change directory to the folder (cd demo-repo)

7. dot get directory -> Hidden folder in the git repo folder 
There is special command to show that folder la command is Mac shorthand for ls space dash la which means list everything in that directory(ls -la). 

8. There is something called dot git -> These hidden git folder actually stores all of that files that save your commits or code changes over time. 
It has all of the changes recorded in the history of this repository which includes the once we made in github.com.
